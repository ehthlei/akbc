His parents put him in the home of a distant relative and they allowed him to attend school.  From 1977 to 1981, he studied at the Karen Baptist Theological Seminary in Burma.  Although his school years were poverty-stricken, Pastor Tha Hser graduated successfully and chose to work as a missionary for five years among indigenous Karen who practiced animism and lived in the mountains.  Pastor Tha Hser got malaria and almost died, but Godâ€™s mercy sustained him." %}
